# Data supporting the study
# A unique volatile signature successfully predicts malaria infection status, even among individuals exhibiting diverse symptoms

Abstract

Recent findings suggest that characteristic changes in human odors caused by malaria infection have significnt potential as diagnostic biomarkers. However, uncertainty remains regarding the specificity of such biomarkers, particularly in populations where many different pathological conditions may elicit similar symptoms.  We explored the predictive capability of volatile biomarkers in identifying malaria infections in Kenyan schoolchildren exhibiting various malaria-like symptoms. Using genetic algorithm models, we were able to identify malaria infection with 100% accuracy for children with fever and 75% accuracy for children with other symptoms. While some of the volatile biomarkers we identified are influenced primarily by symptomology , others are malaria specific and represent a unique volatile signature   that may have   robust diagnostic value even in the presence of other pathogens that elicit similar symptoms.
